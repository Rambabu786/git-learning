2. DIFF:  
---------
Q. What is the difference between Git Status and git diff?
A. The git diff command is often used along with git status and git log to analyze the current state of a Git repo.
   In simple way, File has modified and went to stage, but not added/restore to repository.

Git Status: Will show the files
Git diff: will show the the content
